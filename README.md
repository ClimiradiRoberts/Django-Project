# Django-Project
This is a project for Zuri Scholarship program

I created a new Python virtual environment and initialized it. Then, I installed Django in it and created a new Django project.

I used your ZuriBoard username; TechieClimi_ as the name of the project.

 
## P.S: This is the beginning of my journey using Django
